# Risk of Quake

Risk of Quake is a Risk of Rain 2 clone in Quake 4. You fight hordes of enemies while opening chests to collect items and get stronger.

### Installation

First, you must download the repository files. Click on the Code dropdown menu, then Download the ZIP file. Alternatively, you can clone the repository.

You must own the Steam version of Quake 2. Navigate to your Quake 2 Steam folder. By default, this will be in a path similar to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4`. Copy and paste the `Risk of Quake` folder from the repository into the Steam folder.

Once you launch the game, you can access the mod by clicking `Mods` at the bottom of the main menu. Alternatively, you can create a desktop shortcut. Do this by navigating to your `Quake4.exe` in the aforementioned Steam folder. Create a Desktop shortcut. Then, right click the shortcut and open the Properties window. Here, you can add the text `+set fs_game "Risk of Quake"`. You can now launch the mod by simply opening the shortcut.

### Gameplay

When you spawn in, you will start with no items. There are a number of chests randomly spread across the ground. To open the chests, you need to earn money. Each chest costs 50 cash. You can earn money by killing enemies. Enemies spawn in waves that get progressively harder as time passes, every 90 seconds. Waves will spawn every 15 seconds.

Most items you can get are passive items. Passive items are always active and stack infinitely. They are as follows:
- **Critical Strike Chance**: Gives you an increased chance of dealing double damage.
- **Critical Strike Damage**: When you critically strike, you will deal further increased damage.
- **Flat Damage**: Deal increased base damage.
- **Life Steal**: Heal for a percentage of the damage you deal.
- **Health**: Increase your maximum health.
- **Regeneration**: Increase the rate at which you naturally regenerate health.
- **Shields**: Temporarily boost your health, ignoring maximum health restrictions.
- **Shotgun Modification**: Gain an extra bullet every shot, but decrease the accuracy of your gun.
- **Speed**: Gain movement speed.
- **Jump**: Gain jump height.

You can also pick up active items. Active items must be activated by pressing 'e' and have a cooldown before you can use them again. Most active items last for a limited duration. They are as follows:
- **Armor**: Gain 100 armor.
- **Full Clear**: Instantly kill all enemies on the map. Has a long cooldown.
- **Critical Strikes**: You are guaranteed to critically strike enemies for a short time.
- **Full Heal**: Instantly heal to your maximum health.
- **Invincible**: Become invulnerable for a short period of time.
- **Haste**: Gain a great amount of speed for a short time.
- **Backup**: Spawn in some friendly marines to help you fight enemies.
- **Shotgun**: Greatly increase the number of bullets and spread of your gun for a short time.
- **Invisibility**: Become undetectable but unable to damage enemies for a short time.
- **Teleport**: Teleport a short distance forward.

The goal is to survive for as long as possible. Good luck!
